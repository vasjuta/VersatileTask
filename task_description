Machine Learning Task
The goal of this task is to rapidly research, build, and deploy a machine learning system
that identifies which artist a work of art belongs to.
You’re given a dataset consisting of 9 works of art for each of 6 different artists.
For this task, we’d like to see you write production-ready code to develop the model,
evaluate its performance, and make your model optimize for production.
Lastly, Build a simple API endpoint that outputs your prediction result in JSON format.
(example: { confidence: "44%", prediction: "Claude de Monet" }) the API
will receive the params through a request (example body: { artwork: "..."}) the
artwork.

You can download the dataset here.
